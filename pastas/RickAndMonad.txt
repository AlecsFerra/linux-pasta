To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Haskell. The algebra is extremely abstract, and without a solid grasp of pure mathematics most of the theory will go over a typical programmer's head. There's also Curry, Howard, and Lambek's categoric outlook, which is deftly woven into their system- their personal philosophies draws heavily from Lambda Calculus, for instance. The haskeller understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these theorems, to realise that they're not just symbols- they say something deep about REALITY. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Monad truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Haskell Wiki's existential catchphrase "A Monad is just a Monoid in the Category of Endofunctors," which itself is a cryptic reference to Category Theory's Abstract epic Generalization of Closure Operators over Partially Ordered Sets. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated Imperative Programmers scratching their heads in confusion as Hindley and Milner's genius type system unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Homotopy Univalent Foundations tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the mathematicians' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 generalizations of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž
