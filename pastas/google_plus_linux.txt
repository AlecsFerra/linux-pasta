I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Android, is in fact, Google/GNU/Linux/Android, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Google plus GNU plus Linux plus Android. Android is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU/Linux system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX and licensed by the FSF. Many Android users run a modified version of the Google/GNU/Linux/Android system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Google/GNU/Linux/Android which is widely used today is often called "TouchWiz", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Google/GNU/Linux/Android system, developed by the Google/GNU/Linux/Android Project. There really is an Android, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Google is the all-knowing corporation backing the project. GNU is the slave to socialism and Stallman himself. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. Android is the OS Layer running the entire scene. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Google/GNU/Linux/Android is normally used in combination with Proprietary operating systems: the whole system is basically Google/GNU/Linux/Android with Manufacturer-added Bloatware, or Google/GNU/Linux/Android/Samsung/TouchWiz. All the so-called “Android” distributions are really distributions of Google/GNU/Linux/Android.
