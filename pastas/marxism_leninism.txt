I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're referring to as Marxism, is in fact, Marxism-Leninism, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Marxism plus Leninism. Marxism is not an proletarian revolution unto itself, but rather another necessary component of a fully liberated society made useful by the Marxist core beliefs, shell utilities, and vital means of production comprising a full society as defined by historical-critical theory.

Many countries run a modified version of the Leninist system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Marxism which is widely used today is often called Leninism, and many of its followers are not aware that it is basically the Leninist revolution, developed by comrade Vladimir Lenin.

There really is a Marxism, and these people believe in it, but it is just a part of the society they enjoy. Marxism is the philosophy: the core of your ideological beliefs on what constitutes an ideal society. The philosophy is an essential part of a revolution, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete proletarian revolution. Marxism is normally used in combination with the Leninist revolution: the whole society is basically a Leninist revolution with Marxism added, or Marxism-Leninism. All the so-called Communist societies are really distributions of Marxism-Leninism!
